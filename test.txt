MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with "Note About Forward-Looking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results
Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Seasonality and other
Our advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues, including those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by fluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, and other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.
Revenues and Monetization Metrics
Google Services
Google Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (“Google advertising”) as well as revenues from other sources (“Google other revenues”).
Google Advertising
Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following:
•Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
•YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and
•Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.
We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners’ properties.
Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.
Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.
As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.
Our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:
•advertiser competition for keywords;

•changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;
•changes in device mix;
•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
•fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;
•general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including the effect of COVID-19, geopolitical events, regulations and other measures;
•seasonality; and
•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.
Google Other
Google other revenues are comprised of the following:
•Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store;
•Devices and Services, which includes sales of hardware, including Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;
•YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and
•other products and services.
Google Cloud
Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:
•Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;
•Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and
•other enterprise services.
Other Bets
Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.
For further details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Costs and Expenses
Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.
•TAC includes:
◦Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.
◦Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.
•Other cost of revenues includes:
◦Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).
35
Table of Contents
Alphabet Inc.
 
◦Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).
◦Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell ("hardware costs").
The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.
The main components of our R&D expenses are:
•compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services;
•depreciation; and
•professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.
The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:
•compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and
•spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.
The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:
•compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions;
•expenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and
•professional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.
For additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.
For additional details, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as well as Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

•Revenues were $69.1 billion, an increase of 6% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Cloud segment revenues of $1.9 billion, or 38%, and an increase in Google Services segment revenues of $1.5 billion, or 2%. Hedging gains contributed approximately one percentage point to consolidated revenue growth.
•Total constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 11% year over year reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
•Cost of revenues was $31.2 billion, an increase of 13% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in other costs of revenues.
•Operating expenses were $20.8 billion, an increase of 26% year over year, primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses due to headcount growth and advertising and promotional expenses.
Other information
•On September 12, 2022 we closed the acquisition of Mandiant for a total purchase price of $6.1 billion and added over 2,600 employees. Mandiant's financial results are reported within Google Cloud as of the acquisition date. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
•Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia and effectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. The ongoing effect of these direct actions on our financial results was not material. The broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our future financial results may be unpredictable.
•Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
•Operating cash flow was $23.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022.
•Capital expenditures of $7.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily relate to investments in technical infrastructure.

Google advertising revenues
Google Search & other
Google Search & other revenues increased $1.6 billion and $14.2 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, growth in advertiser spending, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. Growth was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.
YouTube ads
YouTube ads revenues decreased $134 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022, as the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates more than offset growth in our brand and direct response advertising products.
YouTube ads revenues increased $1.1 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The growth was driven by our brand and direct response advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers as well as improvements to ad formats and delivery. Growth was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.
Google Network
Google Network revenues decreased $127 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022, as the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates more than offset strength in AdSense.
Google Network revenues increased $1.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The growth was primarily driven by strength in AdSense and AdMob, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.

Impressions increased from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily driven by growth in Google Ad Manager and AdSense, partially offset by a decline in impressions related to AdMob. The decrease in cost-per-impression from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.
Impressions increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, driven by growth across Google Ad Manager, AdMob, and AdSense. The increase in cost-per-impression from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, and property mix, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.
Google other revenues
Google other revenues increased $141 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising followed by growth in hardware revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Google Play revenues. The growth in YouTube non-advertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in hardware was primarily driven by an increase in phone sales. The decrease in Google Play revenues was primarily driven by a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.
Google other revenues increased $388 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising, partially offset by a decrease in Google Play revenues.

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.
Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.
Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.
These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in charges related to legal matters of $228 million, including the $217 million reduction of the EC fine imposed in 2018. For further details on the EC fine imposed in 2018, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The effective tax rate decreased by 3.6 percentage points from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022.The decrease was primarily driven by a change in unrecognized tax benefits and the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses starting in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generating an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax earnings, including in countries that have lower statutory rates and a decrease in the stock-based compensation-related tax benefit.

Financial Condition
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
As of September 30, 2022, we had $116.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities.
Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to stockholders.
The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):
 	Nine Months Ended
September 30,
 	2021		2022
Net cash provided by operating activities	$	66,718 			$	67,881 	
Net cash used in investing activities	$	(24,507)			$	(14,071)	
Net cash used in financing activities	$	(44,851)			$	(52,128)	
 
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other properties, Google Network properties and YouTube ads. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.
Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, for compensation and related costs, and for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include hardware costs, income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to increases in cash received from revenues, partially offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses, and an increase in tax payments driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses beginning in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and other working capital.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to a net decrease in cash used for purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase of purchases of property and equipment.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.
Net cash used in financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock.
Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Capital Expenditures and Leases
We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.
Capital Expenditures
Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:
•technical infrastructure, which consists of investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including machine learning (collectively referred to as information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and
•office facilities, ground up development projects, and related building improvements.
Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, capital expenditures were $18.3 billion and $23.9 billion, respectively. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $8.3 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively.
Leases
For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, we recognized total operating lease assets of $2.2 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9 years, was $16.8 billion. As of September 30, 2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $4.1 billion, excluding purchase options, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2022 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022.
Financing
We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
As of September 30, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2023 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2026. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities.
As of September 30, 2022, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on our debt.

subsequently retired during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, 46 million shares were Class A stock for $5.2 billion and 323 million shares were Class C stock for $38.7 billion.
European Commission Fines
In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court rejected our appeal on three claims, accepted our appeal on one claim, and reduced the fine to €4.1 billion. We are preparing to appeal to the European Court of Justice. In the second quarter of 2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in the third quarter of 2022.
While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For further details, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Taxes
